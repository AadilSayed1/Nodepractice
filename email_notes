// How to send emails in Node.js with Mailtrap Email API?
// Before we dive into reviewing the rest of the Node.js email packages, it’s worth mentioning a new package that was just released in June of 2022.

// Mailtrap’s very own sending package provides both sending and testing functionality, and we always aim at saving everyone time and simply making life easier.

// With that in mind, it only made sense for us to make a package that allows developers to add a sending functionality to a Node.js application quickly.

// Additionally, it offers integration with Mailtrap API and will be integrated with Nodemailer module in the near future. The API key and other useful resources can be found in this documentation. 

// Install the Mailtrap package: 

// yarn:

yarn add mailtrap

// npm:

npm install mailtrap

Install the template engine:

npm:

npm install email-templates pug

yarn:

yarn add email-templates pug

We should create two files: subject and HTML body.

subject.pug:
= `Hi ${firstName} ${lastName}, happy to see you at My App!`
html.pug:
   h1 Hello #{firstName} #{lastName}
    p.
